Here are a few optimization tips:

Avoid Using eval: Instead of using eval to evaluate the mathematical expression, you might consider using a safer alternative like the ast module to parse and evaluate expressions.

Lambda Function: Use lambda functions with care. In the provided code, a lambda function is used for button callbacks. While this is convenient, it may not be the most performant option. In a larger application, you might consider defining separate functions for each button's callback.

GUI Layout: Use the grid geometry manager efficiently. Grids can be a powerful tool for organizing widgets, but unnecessary nesting and complex grid layouts can impact performance.

These are general tips, and for more specific advice, it would be helpful to know if there are specific performance issues you're encountering or if there are particular parts of the code that seem to be causing high CPU usage.
